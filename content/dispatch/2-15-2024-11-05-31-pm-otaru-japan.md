Almost had the police called on me as I got off the bus in Otaru. I didn't have an IC card to pay for the trip and still hadn't gotten cash ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬


The train to Sapporo is out of service so we're all sardined into a single car. 1.5 hours on here so this should be fun lol. On a positive note, meet these two super nice dudes from Tokyo who told me about some really nice whiskey from Yutchan. Guess I'll need to check that out!
