It's my first proper day after travel in Japan. I'm on a bus to Otaru so I can catch a train to Niseko. 


Here, on a bus filled people on their daily commute, I  cannt't help but feel some gratitude and happiness - I'm about to fulfill a dream - snowboarding in Japan! I might be here by myself, but I think I prefer this first trip this way. Free to explore, make mistakes and make connections on my own schedule. This is exciting!
