I met all of my guest house mates and I can say this is the way to do it. Random people + small guest house to share adventures with is the vibe. I don't need the apr√®s life with this. I could see bringing some friends along and having way better (and cheaper adventures) as well. 


As an aside, Rusutsu sounds like the place to ride. Once I grab my stuff from Niseko today, I'm going to Rusutsu tomorrow.
