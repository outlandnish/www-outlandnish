I'm fairly tipsy at a local karaoke bar after the most delicious bibimbop at a local izakaya in Makkari with my two of my housemates. Our host has been dousing us in sake and highballs. We might die from the booze but this is fucking amazing. This is what travel is all about. Not to mention this is after sharing an amazing day of riding and good vibes with [the Aussie couple]> I'm so happy right now.
