Ended early today. Low visibility initially but it properly opened up. I wanted to keep riding but I haven't had a proper meal since I got to Japan and I want to rectify that. Met a chill bartender who told me getting a work visa to Japan is super easy. Interesting! 


I'd love to get away from the normal job grind even more so and live a life like that. It'll come down to adjusting what work looks like. I just want to soak up experience in the moment and travel more.
