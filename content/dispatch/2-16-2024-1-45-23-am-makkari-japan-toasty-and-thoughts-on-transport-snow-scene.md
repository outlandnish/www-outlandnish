Been awake to the sounds of someone scraping the driveway in Makkari, a rural town between Rusutsu and Niseko. On reflection (in the warmth), there's a lot that parallels Japanese and American small town infrastructure. I wonder why there isn't a higher prevalence of public transportation like other parts of the world. Or is it just my warped perception that it's better elsewhere?


Up here in Hokkaido, the snow scene appears to have a bit of a Catch-22 for me. You have options like Niseko which are great but stupid expensive. It feels like Aspen / Vail prices where a more local community has been priced out (there's spots that go for $20k/night). However, if you want to go to smaller spots that probably have a more chill community, you do need to have a better handle on Japanese and have your own wheels.


For me, it's even more challenging because I can't do groceries to cook for myself as a vegetarian. On top of that, most places don't have vegetarian meals up here. The bartender from yesterday told me any kind of dietary restriction up here is super challenging and I'd agree. 

I hope that's easier / more accessible as I get onto the main island of Honshu.
