I just took two flights and a train to get to Sapporo. None of it was hectic (other than realizing I booked my flight from Narita instead of Haneda to get out to Sapporo). The last bus for Niseko has left so I decided to spend the night in Sapporo at a Hostel.

While the city is quiet and orderly - there's a palpable happiness on the streets. Walking around, I can't but help just feel that happiness infecting me. I made it to Japan! I also adore my hostel - Helios Hostel. If this is what hostel life in Japan is like, sign me up for more.

P.S. Also, there's a surprising number of Indian restaurants here! Why Sapporo? Haha
